    <p>I'm a go with the flow 30 somethingish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbG4wqN0rQ" target="_blank" title="Video that's pretty typical of my sense of humor...">goofball</a> originally from Buckley, Washington. I currently live in Seattle with my fiance Stefan and our hilarious rescue cat Peanut after making life detours to the University of Idaho (GO VANDALS!) and then after graduating, moving on to Spokane, Washington. In Spokane, I worked my first adult job as a lab archaeologist helping out on the largest archaeological dig to ever take place in Idaho States' history. After this project ended, I gave up the archaeology dream and moved back west to Seattle. Since then, I have been working for a luxury travel tour operator. It's been fun and I got to travel a bit but I'm looking forward to the <a href="Practice Website pg2.html" title="Career & Life Goals..."> next chapter</a> with Galvanize.</p>
    
    <p>I've always had a natural interest in history, human behavior and foreign cultures which is why I studied anthropology in college. My favorite movie to this day is <i><b>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</b></i> This lifelong interest in history and other peoples still plays heavily into my hobbies which include traveling, trying/cooking new foods and being with friends and family as much as possible. I also enjoy exploring video game worlds as well, with my favorite games of all time being from the <i><b>Legend of Zelda</b></i> franchise. Give me an open world to explore and I'm a happy camper. Speaking of, growing up at the base of Mt. Rainier in a hunting and fishing family also gave me a great love of being outdoors. I love getting outside! Hiking, camping, snowboarding, wakeboarding, running, salmon fishing and clamdigging out on the coast are just some of the things that get me out of the house from time to time.</p>
